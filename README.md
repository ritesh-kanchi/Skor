# Skor
Skor is an FTC Scoring app I made in a weekend for the 2020-2021 FIRST Tech Challenge Season, Ultimate Goal. You can download it [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skor-ftc-scoring/id1534448549). I've open-sourced it as my FTC journey is over.

If you want to take over Skor, let me know!

Say hello to Skor. Skor is a simple, intuitive FTC scoring app. Designed for the 2020 FIRST Tech Challenge Season: Ultimate Goal, Skor allows you to do everything. Just a little bit simpler.

## Score
With Skor, you can actively score your team and others, whether it is during practice, virtual competition, or scouting. Everything has been designed to be as simple and easy as possible, so you can focus on what really matters: making your robot the best it can be.

## Save
Skor also lets you save your scores over time. This way, you can see your robot improve over time, as well as be able to plot different scores throughout any timeframe.

When looking at saved scores, you get a detailed score breakdown, explaining every single thing that your robot did and didn't do.

## Share
Share your top scores with your team members, friends, etc. Be proud of your robot and share what you have made using the in-built share feature in Skor.
